What and why Angular?

Angular is a framework for building ui.
You can create single page application (SPA) which improves user experience .
You can create resuable component.
MVC at client side .
Quicker development & less dependency on third party library (eg : routing , validation, SSR etc inbuilt)
Angular apps are so fast.

        ================ 1st day ======================= 
         
URL : https://angular.dev/tools/cli/setup-local#install-the-angular-cli

install angular cli gloable : npm install -g @angular/cli
check cli version : ng version
create new project : ng new project_name then cd and go to project.
start/ run project : npm run start || ng serve --open
main.ts file is the main file that loads first when angular project start.
create angular component : ng g c component_name
print variable values : {{ }} (it is called interpolation)
property binding : []
event trigger over input tag , write event name without on keyword and it should be into a parantheses.
like :     <input type="text" (change) = "updateValue()" /> 
or 

Two way binding means typescript to html and html to ts . 
<input type="text"  [(ngModel)] = "inputValue" /> . It is also called banana in the box.


Looping a array
@for(user of users;track user.id) {

}

Decorater : @Input , @Output

pipe are inbuilt function into angular . it applies over variable like : titlecase,uppercase etc
 {{ name | titlecase }} 
generate pipe : ng g p pipes/countryCode

Make custom directive : ng g d directiveName

Angular life cycle method :
constructor : It calls automatically when an instance is created of a class .
these are the method called automatically when a angular project runs . These are also called life cycle method.
ngOnChanges : firstly calls constructor and then call this method. ,
ngOnInit : it calls after ngOnChanges,
ngOnDestroy: it calls after ngInit method.

template variable : we can use over html element .
like : <h1 #templateVarialble></h1>
and then hold it using a Decorater @ViewChild


services : when we require a network request , use services
create a service : ng g s serviceName
we can manage global state using services into angular.
we make make signal with the help of service


        =============== Standalone component ==============
A Standalone component is a type of component that doesn't belong to any specific Angular module.
Less boiler code / configuration.
Lazy loading component is also possible now.
